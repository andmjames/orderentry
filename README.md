# Order Pulling — PMI Tape

A standalone React app for **pulling/verifying orders against a scanner**. Scan the
barcode on a packing list to pull the matching Sales Order from Zoho Inventory, then
scan each case to count it down. The app warns immediately on a wrong item or an
over-scan, and records the lot number of every case scanned.

It shares the look, logo, and Zoho connection approach of the **Order Entry App**.

---

## How it works

1. **Scan the packing list barcode.** It encodes the **Sales Order number**. The app
   pulls that order from Zoho Inventory — draft, open, or closed all work.
2. The **Pick List** screen lists every line with its ordered **Qty**, **U/M**,
   **Cases**, **Item #**, **Description**, **Units/Case**, and **Cases left to Scan**.
3. **Scan each case.** Case barcodes are in the format:

   ```
   ItemNumber,Quantity(units),LotNumber
   ```

   e.g. `RIS2260,36,LOT24A`. Each scan reduces **Cases left to Scan** for that item
   (by `Quantity ÷ Units per Case`) and stores the lot number.
4. **Warnings (immediate, stop-and-restart):**
   - **Wrong item** — the scanned item isn't on the order.
   - **Too many** — scanning that case would exceed the ordered quantity.

   Either one shows a red banner and blocks further scanning until you press **Clear**.
5. **Clear** wipes every scan for the order so you can restart scanning the same order.
6. **Done Scanning** returns to the barcode screen for the next order (it confirms first
   if cases are still outstanding).

Captured lot numbers appear under each row and in the collapsible **Scan log**.

## Configuration (Netlify environment variables)

Zoho credentials live only in the serverless function — they are never sent to the
browser. Set these in **Netlify → Site settings → Environment variables**:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID` | yes | |
| `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes | |
| `ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID` | yes | |
| `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN` | optional | Set for the refresh-token grant. Leave unset to use the client-credentials grant (same as the Order Entry App). |
| `ZOHO_SCOPE` | optional | Defaults include `ZohoInventory.salesorders.READ` + `ZohoInventory.items.READ`. |
| `ZOHO_DOMAIN` | optional | Only if you are not on Zoho US. |

You can copy the same Zoho values you already use for the Order Entry App.

## Deploying to Netlify without GitHub

This app has a build step **and** a serverless function, so the simplest no-Git path is
the Netlify CLI (drag-and-drop only uploads static files and skips functions/build).

```bash
# one-time
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login

# from inside this folder
npm install
netlify init        # choose "Create & configure a new site" (no Git required)
                    # set the env vars above, here or in the dashboard
netlify deploy --build --prod
```

`netlify deploy --build` runs `npm run build` and bundles
`netlify/functions/zoho-salesorder.js` automatically. Re-run that last command any time
you want to push an update.

For local testing: `netlify dev` (serves the React app and the function together with
your `.env`).
